<h1 style="text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:85px">CLIMATE ACTION</h1>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;align-items:center;">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_Development_Goal_13.png/1024px-Sustainable_Development_Goal_13.png" alt="loading image" width="600" height="600">

<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.The effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.


</p>


<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13 or Goal 13) is about climate action and is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts". SDG 13 has targets which are to be achieved by 2030.
</p>

<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">There are 5 targets in total, all of which cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate action. The first three targets are "output targets": Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change. The remaining two targets are "means of achieving" targets: To implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and to promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
</p>

<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history. Currently climate change is affecting the global community in every nation across the world. The impact of climate change not only impacts national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions. By 2018, climate change continued exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods. Over the period 2000–2018, the greenhouse emissions of developed countries in transitions have declined by 6.5%. However, the emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013. In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.</p>
<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">SDG 13 and SDG 7 on clean energy are closely related and complementary. The leading sources of the greenhouse gas savings that countries need to focus on in order to realize their commitments under the Paris Agreement are switching fuels to renewable energy and enhancing end-use energy efficiency.</p>
<h4 style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:30px">IMPORTANCE OF THIS GOAL</h4>
<p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and is likely to surpass 3 degrees Celsius this century – with some areas of the world expected to warm even more. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. Climate change also exacerbates disasters and combating it is absolutely vital to guaranteeing our survival and the wellbeing of future generations.</p>

  <h4 style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:30px">TARGETS OF SGD-13</h4>

  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">13.A Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">13.B Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities*Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.</p>

  <h4 style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:30px">India and Goal 13</h4>

  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">India is the third highest emitter of carbon-dioxide and is responsible for 6.9% of global emissions. However, the emissions intensity of India’s GDP reduced by 12% between 2005 and 2010. In October 2015, India made a commitment to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20-25% from its 2005 levels by 2020 and by 33-35% by 2030. On 2 October 2016 India formally ratified the historic Paris Agreement. India has committed to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020. The Government of India has also adopted a National Action Plan on Climate Change to address this issue directly, as well as a National Mission for Green India. These national schemes are complemented by a host of specific programmes on solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitats, water, sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, and to encourage strategic knowledge for climate change.</p>


  
  <h4 style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:30px">In order to slow the rate of climate change and to shift to a more sustainable economy, the UN Secretary General has proposed six climate-positive actions for governments to take as they go about rebuilding their economies and societies post pandemic.</h4>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">1.Green transition: Investments must accelerate the decarbonization of all aspects of our economy</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">2.Green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">3.Green economy: making societies and people more resilient through a transition that is fair to all and leaves no one behind.</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">4.Invest in sustainable solutions: fossil fuel subsidies must end and polluters must pay for their pollution.</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">5.Confront all climate risks</p>
  <p style = "text-align: center;color:rgb(18, 68, 20);font-size:25px;">6.Cooperation – no country can succeed alone.</p>
